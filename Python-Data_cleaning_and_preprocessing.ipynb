    "# Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "   First step of any data related project is to extract the data, Second is to clean it, which is called as Data Cleaning. \n",
    "\n",
    "   Here I have used the data which is available on LendingClub website but it is not a clean data therefore it needs to be cleaned before it is of any use.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   To start I'll load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame and name it **lending_club_loan_data**. The next step will be to clean this data, as it contains human errors, null values, irregular data formats, outliers, and lengthy texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the specific cleaning steps I'll take:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Remove the first line**: \n",
    "\n",
    "   This line contains extraneous text instead of the column titles, which prevents the dataset from being parsed properly by the pandas library.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Drop unnecessary columns**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The desc column, which contains a long text explanation for the loan that I won't need. \n",
    "   - The url column,which contains links to each loan on Lending Club, accessible only with an investor account.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Eliminate columns with excessive missing values**: \n",
    "\n",
    "    Removing all columns that have more than 50% missing values. This will help streamline the data processing while keeping the dataset meaningful, as it's large enough to remain useful even after these columns are removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I'll name the cleaned dataset **cleaned_loans_2007** and save it as csv file. This will keep the cleaned data separate from the raw data, ensuring that I have the original dataset available if I need to retrieve anything later. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then I'll start feature selection and feature engineering where I'll select which feature can help the model and create new features/column based on other columns to help the model classify defaulters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**To get started with python we need to import some libraries.**"

    " \n",
    " - When a borrower applies for a loan, LendingClub gets the borrower's credit score from FICO — they are given a lower and upper limit of the range that the borrowers score belongs to, and they store those values as fico_range_low, fico_range_high. After that, any updates to the borrowers score are recorded as last_fico_range_low, and last_fico_range_high.\n",

    " - FICO scores continue to be updated by LendingClub after a loan is funded. In other words, while we can use the initial FICO scores (fico_range_low and fico_range_high) — those would be available as part of a borrower's applicaton — we cannot use last_fico_range_low, and last_fico_range_high, as LendingClub may have updated these after the borrower's application.\n",

    " - \"fico_range_low\", \"fico_range_high\" are recorded at the time of loan origination, while the \"last_fico_range_low\" and \"last_fico_range_high\" are regularly updated by Lending Club. So \"last_fico_range_low\" and \"last_fico_range_high\" will leak info from the future for our model so it's better to drop \"last_fico_range_low\" and \"last_fico_range_high\" columns.\n",
